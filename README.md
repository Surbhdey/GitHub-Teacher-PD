**- Session 4: Online IDEs and Review in GitHub Classroom**
This course will go over setting up assignments with online editors such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code), review the student experience, and review assignments as a teacher. Setting up assignments to use editors will ensure students can learn about the various text editors that exist and engage with them as if in industry settings--different industries have different editor preferences! Industries also often use a number of extensions to make their workflow easier, making VS Code and its extensions a useful tool in preparing students for the workforce. Additionally, the use of online editors like MakeCode makes the classroom and its assignments accessible, particularly in the case of classrooms that reach students with different constraints such as storage limitations, restricted access to programs, and more
