Industries also often use a number of extensions to make their workflow easier, making VS Code and its extensions a useful tool in preparing students for the workforce. Additionally, the use of online editors like MakeCode makes the classroom and its assignments accessible, particularly in the case of classrooms that reach students with different constraints such as storage limitations, restricted access to programs, and more
